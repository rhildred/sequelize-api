# sequelize-api
## A very trusting api

```bash
npm install
npm test
npm start
```

This is a restful API for a User model. There is a User controller and User routes to the controller. There is a single page html view that consumes the API. I have set this as a bonus assignment for my dynamic websites sections. You can get up to 5 bonus marks for this:

|Item|Out of|
|-|-|
|make a nicer looking user index.html view|1|
|client side validations|1|
|server side validations|1|
|add email and phone fields to the User model and the form|1|
|add user avatars to your form and list view|1|
|-|-|
|total|5|

I am hoping to show you a bit of what the world for my side project looks like.
