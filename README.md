# sequelize-api
## A very trusting api

```bash
npm install
npm test
npm start
```

This is a restful API for a User model. There is a User controller and User routes to the controller. There is a single page html view that consumes the API. I have set this as a bonus assignment for my dynamic websites sections.

I am hoping to show you a bit of what the world for my side project looks like. With permission, I would like to update this repo with one of your user experiences.
